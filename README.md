# Sveio

A geography game inspired by [Posio](https://github.com/abrenaut/posio), written in ðŸ”¥ðŸš€Rust.

## Configuration

The server uses the following environmental variables, and it also parses the .env file if present:
- `SVEIO_PORT`: The port to serve on. Defaults to `8085`.

There is an example env file, see [`.env.example`](https://github.com/Erb3/sveio/blob/main/.env.example)

## Socket.io

Sveio uses [Socketioxide](https://github.com/Totodore/socketioxide)

Here are some resources to get you started with socketioxide:
